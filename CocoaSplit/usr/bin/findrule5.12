=head1 NAME

findrule - command line wrapper to File::Find::Rule

=head1 USAGE

  findrule [path...] [expression]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<findrule> mostly borrows the interface from GNU find(1) to provide a
command-line interface onto the File::Find::Rule heirarchy of modules.

The syntax for expressions is the rule name, preceded by a dash,
followed by an optional argument.  If the argument is an opening
parenthesis it is taken as a list of arguments, terminated by a
closing parenthesis.

Some examples:

 find -file -name ( foo bar )

files named C<foo> or C<bar>, below the current directory.

 find -file -name foo -bar

files named C<foo>, that have pubs (for this is what our ficticious
C<bar> clause specifies), below the current directory.

 find -file -name ( -bar )

files named C<-bar>, below the current directory.  In this case if
we'd have omitted the parenthesis it would have parsed as a call to
name with no arguments, followed by a call to -bar.

=head2 Supported switches

I'm very slack.  Please consult the File::Find::Rule manpage for now,
and prepend - to the commands that you want.

=head2 Extra bonus switches

findrule automatically loads all of your installed File::Find::Rule::*
extension modules, so check the documentation to see what those would be.
